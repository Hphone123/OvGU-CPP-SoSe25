## Solutions

All Solutions merged into main were solutions as they were submitted. 
All solutions produced all green ticks (If no specified otherwise). 

All solutions merged into feature/solutionImprovement were improved with the benefit of hindsight and should be taken with a grain of salt, as they might use things only explained later in the course or might be harder to explain.

ALl solutions are checked locally and on the submission test server using valgrind, and can not produce any leaks or errors for a submission to be accepted.

## AdHoc

This repo does not include any ad-hoc tasks, as they are commonly used in exams, and therefore were forbidden to be copied or photographed.
